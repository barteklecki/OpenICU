OPENICU  

The situation of recent months and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how great a threat there may be insufficient medical resources including life-saving equipment. In a triage situation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage), doctors have to make extremely difficult decisions every day. We offer an Open Source / Open Hardware device project for life-saving applications (ONLY with no other means available) containing "ICU in a suitcase" for as low as 300$ per bed. This solution consisting of hardware and software developed in an open license using of the shelf, widely available components, using CrowdSourcing (development, prototyping, testing and distributed production) and driven by CrowdFunding. How you can help? Please, consider supporting us financially to build first prototypes thru this fundraiser, donating your ideas to our project (https://github.com/barteklecki/OpenICU) and sharing this project on social media!

Tech-talk

Goal: to design and build a low-cost "ICU in a suitcase" from standard, commercial of the shelf and widely available components, inexpensive and enabling production using relatively simple tools, but also automated production. 
V1 Kit incluse:
3-point ECG (Open Hardware module) with gates for other sensors
finger pulse oximeter (SiO2) sensor
body temperature sensor
pendrive with Linux software that changes any PC in the so-called patient monitor / cardiac monitor (no installation needed) and doubles as a doc-friendly interface to set ventilator parameters
emergency low-cost ventilator (ONLY for “right for try” situation) incl. with the function of smart control and "breathing with the patient" (A/C mode, PSV - no need for muscle paralysis, CPAP), alarms for staff, working using “dirty” and common compressed air sources to create clean breaths.
